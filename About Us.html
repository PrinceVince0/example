<h1><li>Banaue Rice Terraces</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">The Banaue Rice Terraces are among the Philippines' top tourist destinations. Called the 8th Wonder of the Modern World by locals, these terraces are said to have been carved into the mountains and hillsides by the ancestors of the local indigenous Ifugao tribes, and are well over 2,000 years old. The Banaue Rice Terraces (Filipino: Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe) are terraces that were carved into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, in the Philippines, by the ancestors of the Igorot people.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">The Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labour at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The rice terraces in the Philippines are mainly a system of parallel mountain ranges with intervening plateaux’s and they are perceived as an exceptional example of an advanced and living landscape with multiple cultural features. The development of this particular landscape traces its origins back in the pre-colonial era of the Philippines, almost two millennia ago. The broader region that hosts these impressive rice terraces is known as the Philippine Cordillera and can be found on a mountain on the island of Luzon.</p>

<h1><li>San Agustin Church</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">The Church of Saint Augustine (Filipino: Simbahan ng San Agustin, Spanish: Iglesia de San Agustín), also known as the Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Consolation and Cincture (Spanish: Santuario Arquidiocesano de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación y Correa) or the Immaculate Conception Parish (Filipino: Parokya ng Imakulada Conception, Spanish: Parroquia de la Inmaculada Concepción), is a Catholic church under the auspices of the Order of Saint Augustine located inside the historic walled city of Intramuros in Manila, Philippines. The Augustinians decided to rebuild the church using stone, and to construct an adjacent monastery. Construction began in 1586, based on a design by Juan Macías. The structure was built using hewn adobe stones quarried from Meycauayan, Binangonan and San Mateo, Rizal.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">Built between 1587 and 1606, it is the oldest church in the Philippines. The church was built by Juan Macias in 1586 and was completed in 1607. It was renovated in 1854. Inside, a guided pulpit was installed and the altar was adorned with native flora and pineapples as decorative motifs. It served several purposes—as the earliest religious center of the Spanish new colonial outpost in the Philippines. During the Second World War, the Japanese forces turned the San Agustin Church into a concentration camp for prisoners. As the Battle of Manila in 1945 draw to close, the Japanese held hostage priests and hundreds of residents inside the church. To drive out the remaining Japanese, American and Filipino forces conducted an air raid inside Intramuros. The bombardment led to the death of several civilians. After the shelling of Intramuros, structures in the walled city was reduced to rubbles but the San Agustin Church remained one of the standing churches after the war.</p>

<h1><li>Fort Santiago</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">Fort Santiago is one of the oldest fortifications in Manila built by the Spaniards in 1571 from what was once a palisaded structure of logs and earth built by Rajah Soliman on the native settlement called Maynila. The colonizers recognized that the tongue of land where the Pasig River flowed into the Manila Bay was a very strategic location.  The fort was destroyed in 1574 during the Chinese attack led by Limahong.  The stone fort was built between 1589 and 1592 and was repaired and extended after being damaged by the 1645 earthquake. Spanish, British, American and Japanese occupation forces used the fort as their headquarters and a prison for men, women, children and soldiers. In 1951, the Philippine recognized the historical significance of Fort Santiago to our nationhood and declared it a as a National Monument and a National Shrine known as “Shrine of Freedom” in honor of Dr. Rizal and the countless number of people imprisoned, tortured, and martyred here for the cause of freedom. Rizal was kept prisoner at the fort in the lead up to his execution. To this day, many people believe that Rizal's soul lingers, still trapped within the former prison. Fort Santiago (Spanish: Fuerte de Santiago; Filipino: Kutà ng Santiago), built in 1571, is a citadel built by Spanish navigator and governor Miguel López de Legazpi for the newly established city of Manila in the Philippines. The defense fortress is located in Intramuros, the walled city of Manila.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">The fort was named after Saint James (Santiago in Spanish), the patron saint of Spain, who is also known as Saint James the Muslim-slayer because of the legend that he miraculously appeared hundreds of years after his death to fight in the battle of Clavijo, whose relief adorns the façade of the front gate. The fort has a perimeter of 2,030 feet (620 m), and it is of a nearly triangular form. The south front, which looks toward the city, is a curtain with a terreplein, flanked by two demi-bastions - the Bastion of San Fernando, on the riverside, and the Bastion of San Miguel, by the bayside. A moat connected with the river separates the fort from the city. The location of Fort Santiago was once the site of a palisaded fort, armed with bronze guns, of Rajah Matanda, a Muslim Tagalog rajah of pre-Hispanic Manila who himself was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei. The fort was destroyed by maestre de campo (master-of-camp) Martin de Goiti.</p>

<h1><li>Kalanggaman Isaland</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">Kalanggaman Island is a sandbar located in the sea between Leyte and Cebu, in the Visayas Archipelago of the Philippines. It is located 10 kilometres west from the municipality of Palompon, Leyte. Kalanggaman Island serves as a breeding ground for sea turtles and manta rays. It is also home to diverse marine life due to the surrounding coral reefs, making it a popular spot for snorkeling and scuba diving. In 2018, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources raised concerns about the volume of tourist traffic in Kalanggaman, due to the possible environmental impacts it could have on the island's natural habitats. Kalanggaman Island in Leyte is a slice of paradise. Known for its pristine white sandbars stretching into the azure waters, this uninhabited island is perfect for those seeking tranquility. The crystal-clear waters are ideal for snorkeling, revealing a vibrant underwater world. The island’s simplicity, with no major developments, lets you enjoy nature in its purest form.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">It is a perfect getaway for a just a day or a couple of days of camping. The snorkeling as well as the diving is beautiful and enjoyable in the calm waters around Kalanggaman Island. Therefore Sea Explorers Dive Center in Malapascua as well as other dive shops are regularly offering diving and snorkeling trips to Calanggaman. Occasionally overnight stays in tents or hammocks are also being offered. Kalanggaman Island is one of the most beautiful islands in the Visayas sea in the Philippines. It is a perfect site to dive, snorkel around the island, and taste the delicious barbecue. Besides Calanggaman Island ( Kalanggaman Island ), there are many more dive sites in Malapascua worth visiting. See here: Malapascua dive sites</p>

<h1><li>Tumalog Falls</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">Tumalog Falls, Oslob, Cebu, Philippines Standing at approximately 80 to 100 meters in height, the sheer size of this waterfall makes it a unique and an incredible place to visit. The water is crisp and cold which is why it is so refreshing. Tumalog Falls is the second most popular waterfall in Cebu and is usually added onto a day trip whilst seeing the whale sharks at Oslob. This epic waterfall is one to see for its stunning scenery and setting, rather than adventure or a swim. Tumalog Falls is characterised by a huge, rugged cliff where several waterfalls cascade into one large but shallow pool. It is too shallow to swim but you can definitely sit and cool off or have a wade. There isn’t much to Tumalog Falls, just the cliff backing onto the pool. A lot of people rock up, have a very quick look and then head back after realising it isn’t deep enough for a swim. We enjoyed taking in the view and slowing down for a while.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">Getting to Tumalog may look like you’re going deep into the jungle, but it is one of the easiest falls in Cebu to get to as the roads all the way are in good condition. If you have a motorbike, you can get within a 5-10 minute walk of the entrance, but you’ll be driving up and down some of the steepest hills in Cebu. Although this waterfall is not known for its impressive flow of water, it’s sheer height and width definitely impressed us. It’s definitely worth checking out if you are in Cebu, especially for those staying near Oslob!.</p>

<h1><li>Mayon Volcano</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">Mayon (Central Bikol: Bulkan Mayon; Tagalog: Bulkang Mayon), also known as Mount Mayon and Mayon Volcano (Spanish: Monte Mayón, Volcán Mayón),is an active stratovolcano in the province of Albay in Bicol, Philippines. A popular tourist spot, it is renowned for its "perfect cone" because of its symmetric conical shape, and is regarded as sacred in Philippine mythology. The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural Park in 2000. It is the centerpiece of the Albay Biosphere Reserve, declared by UNESCO in 2016, and is currently being nominated as a World Heritage Site. Mayon is the main landmark and highest point of the province of Albay and the whole Bicol Region in the Philippines, rising 2,463 meters (8,081 ft) from the shores of Albay Gulf about 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) away. The volcano is geographically shared by the eight cities and municipalities of Legazpi, Daraga, Camalig, Guinobatan, Ligao, Tabaco, Malilipot, and Santo Domingo (clockwise from Legazpi), which divide the cone like slices of a pie when viewing a map of their political boundaries.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">The concave profile, a hyperbolic sine curve of the volcano is due to the balance between erosion and eruption, defined by the angle of repose of ash. The steepest upper slopes of the volcano reach an average slope gradient of 75%, while the lower foot slope is only an average of 3%. The volcanic crater is about 250 m in diameter. At least 85 lava flows have been identified, and consist mainly of lava augite-hypersthene-andesite, generally fed from the crater. Pyroclastic flows, characterized as a St. Vincent nuee' ardente, leave behind block and ash deposits, and breadcrust bombs in an ash and lapilli matrix. The farthest flow reached 8.5 km along Fidel Surtida, Santo Domingo. Mayon lahars were formed by rainstorms during eruptions, or by torrential rain afterwards. Averaging 230 m in height and 710 m in diameter, 7 cinder cones are found on the southern and southwestern lower slopes. Composed of olivine-augite basalt, these cones have an angle of repose of 34%, with Ligñon Hill as an example. Like other volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, Mayon is a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. It is on the southeast side of Luzon. The Bicol Arc is one of 7 oceanic trench subduction zones defining the Philippine Mobile Belt. Volcanism in the Bicol Arc is related to the westward subduction of the Philippine Plate along the Philippine Trench. The 12 active and inactive volcanoes within the arc include the Mayon Volcano, Mount Bulusan, Mount Isarog, Mount Iriga, Malinao Volcano, and Mount Masaraga. In general, these are calc-alkali basalts, basaltic andesites, and andesites.</p>

<h1><li>Philippine Eagle Center</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">The Philippine Eagle Center is home to 36 Philippine Eagles, 18 of which are captive-bred. It also houses 10 other species of birds, 4 species of mammals and 2 species of reptiles. Simulating a tropical rain forest environment, the Center offers the visitor a glimpse into the country’s forest ecosystem. Although the exhibits are used primarily to help educate the Filipino people on conservation, the facility is also considered a major tourist attraction in Davao City. PEF's Philippine Eagle Center (PEC) is an 8.4-hectare area located at the foothills of Mt. Apo in Malagos, Baguio District, Davao City and situated within the Malagos Watershed. The PEC operates as a conservation breeding facility for the Philippine Eagle and other birds of prey. To inspire visitors to help save this endangered species, the center features various facilities where you can interact with some of the Philippine Eagles here. One of the most popular facilities here is the center's Flight Zone, where they conduct the "Raptors in Flight'' show.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">To prevent the eagle from going the way of the dodo, a captive breeding program was established in the southern metropolis of Davao City - one that eventually evolved into the Philippine Eagle Center, a park/zoo/nursery dedicated to breeding Philippine eagles with the eventual goal of reintroducing them into the wild. Despite its size, the Philippine Eagle is in trouble. Habitat loss has reduced the haribon's numbers drastically. Eagle populations in the wild are hanging on for dear life, with numbers hovering between 180 and 500. There can only be one - the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is known in the local language as haribon, the king of the birds. The massive monarch of the Philippines' forests has a wingspan that exceeds 7 feet, all the better to help it hunt monkeys, monitor lizards and hornbills.</p>

<h1><li>Hinatuan Enchanted River</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">The Hinatuan Enchanted River, also called the Hinatuan Sacred River, is a deep spring river on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. It flows into the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean at Barangay Talisay, Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur. It is found between the boundaries of Barangays of Talisay and Cambatong. It earned the moniker "enchanted river" from the diplomat Modesto Farolan who described the river in his poem entitled "Rio Encantado". The first exploration to the cave of the Hinatuan Enchanted River was made by Alex Santos in 1999. The major exploration to the cave system started eleven years later when a group of three cave divers led by Dr. Alfonso Amores with team members Bernil Gastardo and Emgee Guillermo entered the cave in February 2010. The major exploration led to the discovery of a hidden cave opening at 30 metres (98 ft) depth. Succeeding expeditions have been made that led to the discovery of the underwater cave's chamber. During its sixth expedition on June 17, 2014, Dr. Amores died after failing to exit the narrow entrance to the cave due to a cardiac arrest at 40 metres (130 ft) depth inside the narrow tunnel to the Mayor's Chamber of the cave in the Hinatuan Enchanted River.
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">The river's unusual colors and unexplored depths have inspired various local legends. One story tells of fairies that added the colors of sapphire and jade to the river to make its unique shade. Local fisherfolk also report seeing fish in the river that cannot be caught through any means. In 2017, the local government prohibited swimming in the main pool for preservation and maintenance. At the same time, they designated a swimming area some  33 feet (10 meters) away from the pool. Travelers should keep in mind that the infrastructure by the river is close to zero, thus, there are no facilities to buy medicine or food. HIDDEN IN THE PHILIPPINE JUNGLE is a short stretch of river that seems to pop up out the ground just to send its miraculously clear, blue water out to the sea.</p>

<h1><li>Sunken Cemetery</h1>

<font color=black>
<h4><p style="line-height: 30px">THERE ARE NO FLOWERS OR gravestones to mark the resting places of the lost citizens of Camiguin – only a giant cross rising up out of the water to mark where this place of rest once was. In the 1870s, a volcano near this place erupted and caused the cemetery along with the capital city surrounding it to sink below sea level. In order to commemorate this place of loss, a looming cross was built in remembrance. Visitors all over the Philippines and the world come to admire this man-made marvel filled with legend and enchantment. The Sunken Cemetery, also known as the Old Volcano is a popular sight seeing spot with history. During the 1800s, Mount Vulcan erupted causing the massive devastation on the island. This particular area was hit especially hard, the eruption caused the cemetery and the old capital city to sink below sea level. The Sunken Cemetery, also known as the Old Volcano is a popular sight seeing spot with history. During the 1800s, Mount Vulcan erupted causing the massive devastation on the island. This particular area was hit especially hard, the eruption caused the cemetery and the old capital city to sink below sea level. Following the tragedy, the local government erected a large cross in its spot to mark the burial ground's location. Since it sunk, the locals of Camiguin head to the nearby shore every November 1 to offer flowers and wreaths to commemorate their ancestors who now rest underwater. 
<h4><br><p style="line-height: 30px">The story of the Sunken Cemetery can be traced back to the 1800s when Mount Vulcan was still an active volcano. It first erupted in 1827, followed by a second one in 1862. However, its third eruption in 1871 was its most destructive, causing the cemetery to sink. It sunk deeper when Mt. Vulcan erupted once again in the 1960s. Faith is not something we always see in tropical island destinations. The island of Camiguin, however, is different. After all, in a land where seven volcanoes lie, faith goes a long way. The faith and devotion of the people of Camiguin is apparent in many of its most popular attractions such as those in Catarman — the Walkway to the Old Volcano and the Sunken Cemetery. Those volcanic peaks have erupted many times in the past. Sunken Cemetery is easily one of the most unique and recognizable landmarks not just in Camiguin – but in the whole Philippines.
